# Section 1 Progam Requirements

## Introduction

In this class we are going to learn fundmentals of programming by creating a terminal application that can generation math home work for export or for completion in the terminal. You can expect to learn about variables, data types, and basic flow of a program.

We will not cover things like memory allocation, other programming languages besides python, and more complex user interface like a web application.

## Project Overview

Anytime a piece of software is developed it is address a specific issue for either an individual or a group of people. If you think about some software you have interacted with we should be able to identify the problem the developer was trying to solve.

**Example Programs**

- WhatsApp: The developers wanted to replace text messaging which at the time had fees per text.
- Google Chrome: The developers wanted a simple to use browswer to allow people to access the internet

Can you think of any programs you have used and what problem the developers where trying to solve?

### Our project

The project we are going to build also solves a problem.

**The Problem**

My daughter needs to practice math but creating problems for her is time consuming and hard to consistently randomize

**The Solution**

Create a program that can generate random math problems. The problems should include addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. The user should be able to choose what type of questions are returned and the amount of problems.

Ensure the program can handle common errors like the user inputting incorrect values.

## Python

Python is a high-level, versatile programming language known for its readability and ease of use. It supports multiple programming styles (such as object-oriented, procedural, and functional programming) and is widely used because of its extensive libraries and active community. Python is often chosen by beginners due to its simple syntax, but it’s also powerful enough for advanced applications.

Learning Python can open doors to many careers, including:
	•	Software Developer – building applications, tools, and systems.
	•	Data Scientist / Analyst – analyzing data, creating models, and finding insights.
	•	Machine Learning / AI Engineer – developing intelligent systems and algorithms.
	•	Web Developer – creating dynamic websites and backend systems.
	•	Automation Engineer – writing scripts to automate tasks and workflows.
	•	Cybersecurity Specialist – using Python for security tools, testing, and analysis.

Because Python is used across so many industries—technology, finance, healthcare, education, and more—mastering it can lead to a wide range of opportunities.
