# 4 Implement for Loop for num_problems

## Topics Covered

- Range and use with a For Loop
- For Loop

## Actions

Now we will implement a better solution for our num_problems issue. Instead of writing 10s or even hundreds of if statements we will use a for loop. The for loop allows us to repeat the same action over and over based on requirements we provide. For a loop that creates a math problem matching the users requested amount we will use a range. The range allows us to tell the computer to repeat the action as many times as the user has requested. 

We will also implement some if statements to print out whichever math problem types are requested. You should quickly notice the flaw in this logic because every problem says it is every type of math problem. 

We will fix this in the next section.
