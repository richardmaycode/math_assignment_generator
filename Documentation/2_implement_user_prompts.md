# 2 Implement User Prompts

## Topics Covered

1. How to show the something to the User
2. How to ask the user a question
3. Using variables to use the users resonse in our program

## Actions

In this section we are going to make our program introduction itself and ask the user questions. We are going to ask the user what type of math problems they want to generate and how many. These two prompts will ensure our program runs as the user expects. 

Imagine if the program didn't ask the user any questions and instead just randomly generated whatever it wanted. This would not make for a very usefull program requiring the user to run it over and over to get the output they actually want. 

**Print and Prompt Methods**

```python
  print("Hello User!")
  prompt("What is your name? ")
```

**Variable Assignment**

```python
  num_variable = 10
  float_variable = 10.0
  string_variable = "Test"
```
